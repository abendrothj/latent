# Quantum Computing

Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanical phenomena like **superposition** and **entanglement** to perform computations that would be infeasible for classical computers.

## Key Concepts

### Superposition

Unlike classical bits (0 or 1), quantum bits ([[qubits|qubits]]) can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously. This allows quantum computers to explore many solutions in parallel.

### Entanglement

Quantum entanglement creates correlations between qubits that have no classical analog. Measuring one entangled qubit instantly affects its partner, regardless of distance.

### Quantum Gates

Quantum gates manipulate qubits through unitary transformations. Common gates include:

- **Hadamard gate**: Creates superposition
- **CNOT gate**: Creates entanglement
- **Pauli gates**: Single-qubit rotations

## Applications

### Cryptography

Shor's algorithm can factor large numbers exponentially faster than classical algorithms, threatening current RSA encryption.

See: [[shors-algorithm|Shor's Algorithm]]

### Drug Discovery

Quantum computers can simulate molecular interactions at the quantum level, accelerating drug discovery and materials science.

### Optimization

Quantum annealing can solve complex optimization problems in logistics, finance, and machine learning.

## Current Limitations

- **Decoherence**: Quantum states are fragile and easily disturbed
- **Error rates**: Current qubits have high error rates
- **Scalability**: Building large-scale quantum computers remains challenging
